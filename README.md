# instin-iot
You will need your device id and your access token for your Photon.
Go to the build.particle.io portal. Locate your access token, which is under settings. Record it. Locate your device item and find its id. Record that :) 

Once deployed to Azure, you will need to:
* turn on websockets. Go to Configure - find WebSockets, turn that on. Save. 
* Add in app setting variables so that your device id and access token is avail. Add one for ACCESS_TOKEN and then one for DEVICE_ID
